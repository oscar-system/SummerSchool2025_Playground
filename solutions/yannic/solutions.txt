Determinants

How many different algorithms for determinants are implemented? What rings do they cover? Where are they defined?

Hint: (in AbstractAlgebra: df_df, _interpolation, _clow, _fflue, _popov Nemo: det_given_divisor Hecke Oscar)

-> Hecke: det(SMat{ZZRingElem}), det_mc, | Groups: det(MatrixGroupElemm)

Can you find refernces/ explanations for the algorithms implemented? How many can you call?
Galois Theory

Let
be for f =


. This field is not normal.

    Find the normal closure
    Find the Galois group
    Compare the Galois group to the automorphism group
    Demonstrate the Galois-Correspondence (for the normal closure): For each subgroup of the Galois group find the corresponding subfield (This can be done “by hand” using automorphisms and automatically using the Galois machine)

Group Extensions

Construct all group extensions of
by

.

What are the possible Galois groups for a field

of degree 4 that has a subfield of degre 2 as well? Can you match this to the group extensions?
Schur indices

Find a character and a group s.th. the Schur index is 2
Discriminants of number fields

Find a cubic cyclic field where the discriminant has 10 digits.
Ramification

Let
be a normal number field and be a prime ideal in lying above the prime number . The ramification theory says that there is a field s.th. is totally split, a field s.th. is inert and s.th.

is totally ramified.

Find an explicit example and veryfy the properties above.

If this is too boring: for non-normal fields, there is a correspondence between prime ideals and double cosets of the Galois group…
Group basics

Let
be dihedral of order . Create

as

    a permutation group
    a PC group
    a FP group

Find all irreducible representations of

.

Harder: Create

as a group of 2x2 matrices over a suitable number field (or over the algebraic closure of QQ).
Subgroups

Let

.

    How many subgroup does 

have?
Can you do this without finding all?
Find permutation representations of
of degree , and

    How many characters are rational?

Subgroup lattices

Let

. Find the

    subgroup lattice
    the sub-lattice of transitive subgroups Assign names to as many of them as you can.

Hint/comment: draw the lattice on paper and label the groups by some id

    Find its genus.
    Is it smooth?
